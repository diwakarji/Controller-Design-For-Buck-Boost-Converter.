A power electronics converter's output voltage may fluctuate in response to changes in the load, the input voltage, or the switching device's duty cycle. A controller is essential to achieving a steady output voltage. The input voltage of PV solar plants varies greatly in many real-world situations, which also causes the output DC voltage to rise, which is highly undesirable.
